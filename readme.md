# Windy Gridworld
This repository contains my solution to the windy gridworld problem from Sutton & Barto. There is a gridworld with a crosswind running upward through the middle of the grid. The actions are the standard fourâ€”up, down, right, and left. The goal is the reach the end position from the start.

 The strength of wind is given below each column. If you are at a position with wind 2, and you choose to move right, you will move 2 upwards and 1 right. Wind was randomly initialized and 1000 simulations were ran for each of the algorithms with different wind speeds each time.

## Algorithms used
On-policy SARSA and Q-learning were used. To compare the two, a plot of the episode length over number of episodes was done. The lower the episode length, the faster the agent reached the goal. I also experimented with a few features of C++20.
